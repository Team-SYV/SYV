  answerRelevance:
    "Your answer was a bit confusing and lacked clear structure. While you mentioned a project where you led a team, the explanation was unclear about the challenge you faced and how you navigated it. In a response to this question, you should provide a clear narrative by explaining the context (situation), the problem you encountered, the actions you took to solve it, and the results you achieved. This will allow the interviewer to better understand your problem-solving and leadership abilities.",
  
  grammar:
    "Your answer could benefit from improved clarity by paying closer attention to the correct usage of articles and prepositions. For example, instead of saying 'I leave my team for the requirements,' the correct phrasing would be 'I led my team to meet the requirements.' Additionally, be mindful of verb tenses—use past tense when describing actions you have already completed, and present tense when referring to your current role or responsibilities.",
  
  eyeContact:
    "Your eye contact during the interview was inconsistent. Maintaining steady eye contact with the interviewer is important as it conveys confidence and helps build rapport. Aim to keep eye contact for about 50-60% of your answer, especially when making key points, but don’t stare aggressively. If you need to look away to gather your thoughts, do so briefly and return to eye contact promptly.",
  
  paceOfSpeech:
    "Your pace of speech was inconsistent. There were moments when you spoke too quickly, making it difficult for the interviewer to follow your thoughts. When you speak too quickly, you might appear anxious, and the interviewer may miss important details. At other times, your speech was too slow, which can come across as hesitation or uncertainty. Try to find a balance—speak clearly and at a moderate pace so the interviewer can absorb your points without feeling rushed or bored.",
  
  fillerWords:
    "You frequently used filler words such as 'um,' 'uh,' 'like,' and 'you know.' These fillers are distracting and can make you sound less confident. To avoid fillers, practice pausing for a moment before speaking. Pauses give you time to collect your thoughts and make your response sound more confident and polished. Try recording yourself to become aware of the fillers and practice reducing them."
